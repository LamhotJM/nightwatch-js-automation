# nightwatch-automation

Nightwatch.js is a testing solution that lets you use JavaScript (an easy-to-learn scripting language) to write browser-based, end-to-end tests. Whilst you may not be well versed in JavaScript, Nightwatch is put together in a way that makes testing a breeze.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install nightwatch
$ sudo selenium-standalone install && selenium-standalone start
$ npm i
$ npm t
```
